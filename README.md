At [Aineko](https://aineko.dev/), we believe in Open Source and Open Standards. We're developing a framework that makes it simple to build, deploy, and scale data-intensive applications.

## Aineko Open Source

* [Aineko](https://github.com/aineko-dev/aineko), the core framework for building Aineko apps.
* More coming soon...
