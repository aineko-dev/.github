At [Aineko](https://aineko.dev/), we believe in Open Source and Open Standards. We're developing a python framework that makes it simple to build, deploy, and scale event-driven AI applications.

## Aineko Open Source

* [Aineko](https://github.com/aineko-dev/aineko), the core framework for building Aineko apps.
* [Aineko Dream](https://github.com/aineko-dev/aineko-dream) generative templating for the Aineko framework.
* More coming soon...
